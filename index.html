              I work since three years ago at G&F. It is a company specialized in financial products. My main
              activity was related with the development of a set of web applications that manage a bank customer database.
              During my experience in this project i worked close to the customer,being in charge of most deployment on 
              productive enviroments. Finally i become the development team leader, and started coaching other members
              of the team, with technical excellence as a goal. 

              Currently, i am performing as a technical leader. It is a new profile in the company, with the objective of 
              improving products internal quality, and coaching about technical skills.

              This was my first experience as a developer. DocSolutions was a start up company when i join them. There i worked
              with other five colleagues on several projects, most of those consisted on development and maintenance of web sites (e.g. Cinepolis),
              web services (e.g. Movistar) and web applications (e.g. GeDeCo).
